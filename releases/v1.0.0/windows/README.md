# Windows Executable

The Windows executable (DearImGuiRedisAssistant.exe) will be automatically built and placed here by GitHub Actions on the next push to the main branch.

To build manually on Windows:
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 with C++ support
2. Run `build-windows.bat`

The executable will be self-contained and require no external dependencies.
